# DNN/CNN
 
The model, composed by two deep neural networks, has the dudty of categorizing and detect objects using a CNN in order to recognize actions with a fast learning pace - fully connected network (FNN). The convolutional neural network is adopted from [Mask-RCNN from Matterpport](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN), to track the objects thanks to the masks created on them.

This repository does not show fully functional code as we cannot disclose further results, for more information do not hesitate contacting me.

The repository is brand new so the code is not debugged and well explained already. Nevertheless, there are a bunch of readme explaining how the different files work and all of the scripts are ready to run with small demos to get a preview of the project.

Thanks for your support!

Marcos.
